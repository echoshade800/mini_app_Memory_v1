# Sound System Complete Rewrite

## Overview
Completely rewrote the sound system to implement new requirements for card matching and combo sounds.

## New Sound Requirements Implemented

### 1. Card Match Sounds
- **Non-combo card matches**: Play `c6` sound (https://dzdbhsix5ppsc.cloudfront.net/monster/tinified/c6102822.mp3)
- **Combo sounds**: Different sounds for different combo counts:
  - Combo ×2: `d6` (https://dzdbhsix5ppsc.cloudfront.net/monster/tinified/d682020.mp3)
  - Combo ×3: `e6` (https://dzdbhsix5ppsc.cloudfront.net/monster/tinified/e682016.mp3)
  - Combo ×4: `f6` (https://dzdbhsix5ppsc.cloudfront.net/monster/tinified/f6102819.mp3)
  - Combo ×5: `g6` (https://dzdbhsix5ppsc.cloudfront.net/monster/tinified/g682013.mp3)
  - Combo ×6: `a6` (https://dzdbhsix5ppsc.cloudfront.net/monster/tinified/a6102820.mp3)
  - Combo ×7: `b6` (https://dzdbhsix5ppsc.cloudfront.net/monster/tinified/b682017.mp3)
  - Combo ×8+: `add` (https://dzdbhsix5ppsc.cloudfront.net/monster/tinified/add408457.mp3)

### 2. Completion Page
- **No sounds**: Completion/settlement page has no sound effects
- Implemented via `setCompletionPage(true)` flag

### 3. Sound Effects Toggle
- **Respects user setting**: When sound effects are disabled in profile, no sounds play
- **Global control**: All sound methods check `isSoundEnabled()` before playing

### 4. Haptic Feedback Toggle
- **Respects user setting**: When haptic feedback is disabled in profile, no vibrations occur
- **Global control**: All haptic methods check `isHapticEnabled()` before triggering

### 5. Combo Reset Logic
- **Proper sequencing**: When combo is interrupted, sounds restart from the beginning
- Example: If you have 9x combo and then fail, next match plays c6 sound (combo ×1)

## Technical Implementation

### SoundManager.js (Completely Rewritten)
- New class-based architecture
- Preloads all sounds for each level
- Handles combo sound logic automatically
- Manages completion page flag
- Proper cleanup and resource management

### Game Logic Updates
- `app/game/[levelId].js`: Updated to use new sound system
- `app/(tabs)/index.js`: Updated cleanup logic
- Removed old sound handling functions
- Integrated with existing combo counting logic

### Key Features
1. **Automatic Sound Selection**: Based on combo count, automatically plays correct sound
2. **Completion Page Silence**: No sounds during score display
3. **Combo Reset**: When combo breaks, sounds restart from combo ×1
4. **Resource Management**: Proper cleanup and memory management
5. **Error Handling**: Graceful fallback if sounds fail to load

## Files Modified
- `utils/SoundManager.js` - Complete rewrite
- `utils/HapticUtils.js` - New haptic feedback utility
- `store/useGameStore.js` - Added haptic feedback toggle
- `app/game/[levelId].js` - Updated sound integration + bomb powerup sounds + haptic feedback
- `app/(tabs)/profile.js` - Updated to use store settings
- `app/(tabs)/index.js` - Updated cleanup logic
- `components/ScoreProgressBars.js` - Updated haptic feedback calls

## Testing
- All sounds preload on level start
- Combo sounds play correctly for 2-7x combos
- 8x+ combos play add sound
- Completion page is silent
- Sound effects toggle works correctly
- Haptic feedback toggle works correctly
- Combo reset works correctly
- Bomb powerup plays same sounds as manual matching
- Proper cleanup on navigation

## Notes
- Sounds are loaded asynchronously and cached per level
- No sounds play during completion/settlement animations
- Combo reset logic ensures proper sound sequencing
- All old sound system code has been removed
